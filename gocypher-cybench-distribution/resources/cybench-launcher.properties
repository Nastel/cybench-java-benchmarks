### All the property fields that starts with name javaOptions will be used while benchmarking as JVM properties ###
### e.g. -Xmx4096m -Xms4096m -server -XX:NewSize=512M
javaOptions=

### Provide full path to java.exe to be used e.g. D:/jdk180_162/bin/java.exe ###
javaToUsePath=

### Provide jar's with JMH benchmarks which shall be executed with CyBench
benchmarks=

### Benchmarks activity configuration properties ###
###  Choose if the report generated will be automatically uploaded
sendReport=true
###  Define public or private property for the uploaded report visibility
reportUploadStatus=public
reportUploadToken=
###  Choose the uploaded report name ( Can be leaved empty if not required ).
reportName=
###  Uncomment to execute only the selected benchmarks.
###  Specify benchmarks by including fully qualified benchmark class names which are comma separated.
###  Change this only if you know what you are doing !!!
#benchmarkClasses=<fully qualified benchmark implementation class names, comma separated if multiple ones i.e. NumberBenchmarks>


### Benchmarking execution configuration properties ###
###  Change this only if you know what you are doing !!!
###  Number of separate full executions of a benchmark (warm up+measurement), this is returned still as one primary score item
numberOfBenchmarkForks=1
###  Number of measurements per benchmark operation, this is returned still as one primary score item
measurementIterations=5
###  Number of seconds dedicated for each measurement iteration
measurementSeconds=5
###  Number of iterations executed for warm up
warmUpIterations= 1
###  Number of seconds dedicated for each warm up iteration
warmUpSeconds=5
###  Number of threads for benchmark test execution
runThreadCount=1

### You can add your own properties by describing the property to start with user.<prop-name>, these will not be added to system properties, just to the report###
#user.propname1=
#user.propname2=

### Metadata for the categories of benchmark tests
#benchmarkMetadata=com.gocypher.cybench.launcher.CollectionsBenchmarks=category:Collections;
